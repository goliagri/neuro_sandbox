This code identifies proposals between fragments that align with the same
ground truth skeleton and are structurally consistent.

    Algorithm
    ---------
    1. Find fragments aligned to a single ground truth skeleton and build a
       dictionary that maps these fragment IDs to the corresponding ground
       truth ID.

    2. Iterate over all proposals generated between fragments. A proposal is
       accepted if:
            - Both fragments align to the same ground truth skeleton.
            - Proposal is structurally consistent, meaning the connection
              preserves geometric continuity and branching topology consistent
              with the ground truth structure.

Note: We use the convention that a fragment refers to a connected component in
      "pred_graph".
